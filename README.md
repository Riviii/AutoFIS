## **Overview**

The rapid technological advancements, coupled with the imperative for efficient fisheries management and marine conservation in the Indian subcontinent, have spurred the development of an innovative AI-ML-based tool for fish species identification. This project introduces a cutting-edge solution that harnesses the power of advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address the complexities of aquatic biodiversity in the region.


## **Dataset**

The cornerstone of this research is a meticulously curated dataset comprising diverse images of fish species endemic to the Indian subcontinent. Notable species include "Catla," "CommonCarp," "Mori," "Rohu," and "SilverCarp." Given their pivotal role in the region's aquatic ecosystems and fisheries, accurate identification is paramount.


## **Web Interface**

A user-friendly web interface complements the model, providing local fishermen and researchers with a seamless platform to upload fish images for instant identification. This inclusive approach empowers stakeholders by granting them access to a powerful tool for sustainable fisheries management and marine conservation.

## **Impact**

As this project reaches its culmination, the AI-ML-based tool stands as a transformative milestone in the fields of marine biology and resource management. Its potential to extend beyond the studied fish species dataset and adapt to real-world scenarios promises to usher in a new era of scientific research, education, and sustainability in the Indian subcontinent. This innovative solution aligns with the urgent global need for effective fisheries management and marine conservation, setting the stage for a brighter and more sustainable aquatic future in the region.
